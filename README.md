## âœ¨ Key Advantages

- **High Efficiency**  
  Parallel probing with adaptive rate control reduces measurement overhead by approximately 60%.

- **High Accuracy**  
  Leveraging EUI-64 and IPv6 IPID features, it achieves an overall accuracy of 85.8%, representing an 86% improvement over existing methods.

- **Wide Coverage**  
  Successfully classifies over 53% of 2.05 million router addresses in RIPE Atlas and CAIDA ITDK datasets.

- **Lightweight Design**  
  Sends only 16 packets per device, minimizing scanning footprint and reducing the likelihood of triggering security alarms.
